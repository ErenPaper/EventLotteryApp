# CMPUT 301 – Event Registration App (Group Project)

Android application developed as part of CMPUT 301 that allows event organizers to manage event registration using a lottery-based waiting list system. 
Users can join events via QR codes, receive real-time updates, and manage participation through in-app notifications. 
The system supports multiple roles (entrant, organizer, admin) and integrates Firebase for data storage and synchronization.

### My Contributions

I primarily worked on the notification system and automated testing infrastructure, while also contributing to system design and UI features.

- Implemented push notification logic to notify entrants when they were selected or not selected from the event lottery.
- Added user-facing notification preference controls, allowing users to enable or disable event notifications.
- Fixed bugs related to notification delivery and UI state handling.
- Wrote and maintained unit tests using JUnit to validate notification behavior and application logic.
- Assisted with UML design diagrams during planning and development.
- Contributed to QR code–related functionality and integration for event access.
- Helped with UI design and refinement across multiple screens.

#### Tech Stack
- Android (Java)

- JUnit for unit testing

#### UI Design & Storyboard
UI designs and user flow storyboards can be found in 'storyboard' and 'ui-mockups'
